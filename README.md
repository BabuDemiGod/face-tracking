# Face Recognition in a Crowd, using OpenCV ( Computer Vision ) using Python Programming Language

This blog lets you recognize faces in a crowd from a video.

The code just runs thru a video grab and identifies the faces and eyes in it.

Uses the Haar Classifier Python engine to recognize the faces.

To run the program : ( to change the video, open the facialrecognition.py file and change the name of the video )

	python3 facialrecognition_in_crowd.py  

This will read the video of CrowdatTrumpRally.mp4 - play it and identify the faces.
No! it will not recognize the faces - but just identify the faces in blue rectangles.

The trainer.py file in the current folder has no role in this.


To try new samples : Go to Youtube and download the video using this link

Select MP4 and Download the file.

Feed this file to the program.
